## Notes for the Workshop
- The API occasionally rate-limits with HTTP 429 when called rapidly; add retry/backoff logic in production.
- Responses are simple enough to show raw JSON in the IDEâ€™s HTTP client.
- Because the workshop environment may sit behind corporate proxies, have a backup plan (recorded responses or local mock server).
